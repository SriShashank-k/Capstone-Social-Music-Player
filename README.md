# Social Music Player (UNH Master‚Äôs Project)

This project was built as part of my final Master‚Äôs coursework at the University of New Hampshire (2025). It's a socially interactive music player that combines modern frontend technologies with a serverless backend to enable real-time communication and cloud-based audio playback.

## üîß Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Auth & APIs:** Spotify OAuth 2.0, Spotify Web API, YouTube Embeds
- **Backend (serverless):** Firebase Firestore
- **Features:**
  - Spotify login & playlist browsing
  - Real-time chat with Firestore
  - YouTube music playback
  - Responsive UI with dynamic routing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- YouTube playback lacks synchronization
- No custom user system beyond Spotify login
- Minimal chat moderation
- Not yet production-scaled

## üìà Future Improvements
- Group listening and sync playback
- Advanced chat moderation
- Mobile app version
- User accounts with custom profiles

## üß† What I Learned
This project helped me understand real-time systems, OAuth flows, and serverless design patterns. It also improved my comfort with external APIs and React-based architecture under a cloud-first model.
